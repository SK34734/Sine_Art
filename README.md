What your project is/does (and what it's called)
Why you made your project
How you made your project
What you struggled with and what you learned

My project is Sine_Art. This website displays sine waves of the frequencies the user enters. The user must enter a letter from A-G, and the website plays you a frequency
depending on what you enter. You are able to control the color, thickness, and volume of the wave as it plays. I made this project to fufill the requirements of the Athena Award. 
I made the project on Intelij, and followed the osciliart tutorial provided by the Hack Club. I struggled with following the tutorial, as the directions were not very clear. I was struggling with
the order of the code, and where to place each function. This ended taking many hours to finish. However, I learned the importance of patient and how useful Javascript can be. Javascript
makes a website come to life, and is essential for any interactive website.
